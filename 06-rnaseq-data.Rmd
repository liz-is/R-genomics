```{r, echo=FALSE}
metadata <- read.csv('./data/Ecoli_metadata.csv')
```

> ## Learning Objectives 
* Understand "long" vs "wide" data structures
* Use the `gather` function from the tidyr package to transform data from "wide" to "long"
* Use the "join" family of functions from the dplyr package to combine datasets
* Create plots to explore RNA-seq data

```{r}
load("~/Desktop/counts.df.RData") #
counts.df <- tibble::rownames_to_column(counts.df, "ensembl_gene_id")
write.table(counts.df, file = "~/Documents/Data Carpentry workshop Jan 2018/lessons/R-genomics/rna-seq-counts.tsv", sep = "\t", quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE)
```
